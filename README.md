# MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEER / DATA SCIENTIST 

This project was created as part of a recruitment task. The data was provided as a csv file.
The task consisted in performing an initial data analysis and developing a model which predicts the price based on the other attributes.
At last the proposed model should be discussed and possible future improvements mentioned.
The notebook was written in the evenigs during approximately one week.


Here is the original introduction of the task:

"Here is a small example dataset (csv file) with 10k records. The target variable is **Price**.
You have 7 attributes and obviously we want you to build some initial ML model which predicts 
the prices.

Here how the dataset looks: 

loc1,loc2,para1,dow,para2,para3,para4,price

0,01,1,Mon,662,3000.0,3.8,73.49

9,99,1,Thu,340,2760.0,9.2,300.0

0,04,0,Mon,16,2700.0,3.0,130.0

4,40,1,Mon,17,12320.0,6.4,365.0


### 1. Make some initial data analysis, which will hint to some stuctures in the data and how attributes are connected.

### 2. Fit some ML model(s) and explain briefly your choices.

### 3. Show with some X-validation the power of your model and comment the results.

### 4. Present us the results and the steps you have taken and also with some critical thinking and next steps."
